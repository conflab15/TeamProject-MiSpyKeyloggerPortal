# Team Project - Mi-Spy Keylogger Portal
Our team project was to develop a keylogger application for windows, and to write logged messages to an Azure hosted SQL Server. 
The Portal was developed using ASP.NET Core MVC, in .NET 5, which reads from the SQL database to show logged messages to the parent/guardian of the user.
The messages are displayed in a Paginated List, where the user can select how many records are shown per page.
